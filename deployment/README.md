**Use the following commands to interact with and test the pod.yml manifest:**

Here's how this Deployment works:

1. When you create or apply this Deployment, it ensures that two Pods matching the label selector conditions are running at all times.
2. The Deployment creates the initial two Pods based on the template defined in the **`template`** section.
3. If any of these Pods fail or are deleted, the Deployment automatically replaces them to maintain the desired count of two replicas.
4. The label selector conditions are used to identify which Pods are managed by this Deployment.
5. You can easily update the Deployment to a new version by changing the Pod template or the Docker image. Kubernetes will perform rolling updates to ensure minimal disruption to the application.

Now, let's go through some common commands related to Deployments:

- Create or apply the Deployment using **`kubectl apply`**:
    
    ```bash
    kubectl apply -f your-deployment-file.yaml
    ```
    
- View information about the Deployment:
    
    ```bash
    kubectl get deployment mydeployments
    ```
    
- Describe the Deployment for more details:
    
    ```bash
    kubectl describe deployment mydeployments
    ```
    
- Scale the Deployment to a different number of replicas (e.g., 3):
    
    ```bash
    kubectl scale deployment mydeployments --replicas=3
    ```
    
- Trigger a rolling update to a new version by modifying the Pod template or image and applying the changes:
    
    ```bash
    kubectl apply -f your-updated-deployment-file.yaml
    ```
    
- Roll back to a previous version if issues arise during an update:
