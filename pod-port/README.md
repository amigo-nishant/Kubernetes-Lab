**Use the following commands to interact with and test the pod.yml manifest:**

The pod.yml manifest file defines a Kubernetes Pod named testpod4 with a single container (c00) running an Apache HTTP Server (httpd) image. The container exposes port 80, indicating that it can receive incoming network traffic on that port.

2. To view information about the Pod:
    
    ```bash
    kubectl get pod testpod4
    ```
    
3. To describe the Pod for more details:
    
    ```bash
    kubectl describe pod testpod4
    ```
    
4. To access the logs of the container within the Pod:
    
    ```bash
    kubectl logs testpod4 -c c00
    ```
    
5. To access a shell in the container for troubleshooting:
    
    ```bash
    kubectl exec -it testpod4 -c c00 -- /bin/bash
    ```
    
6. kubectl get pods -o wide 
    
    ```jsx
    NAME                             READY   STATUS    RESTARTS        AGE     IP          NODE             NOMINATED NODE   READINESS GATES
    testpod4                         1/1     Running   0               78s     10.1.0.94   docker-desktop   <none>           <none>
    ```
    
7. `curl  10.1.0.94:80` —> We should see “It works” means port is exposed 
8. To delete the Pod:
    
    ```bash
    kubectl delete pod testpod4ed to the container.
    ```
